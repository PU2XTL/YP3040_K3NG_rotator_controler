# YP3040_K3NG_rotator_controler
Azimut and Elevation Rotator Controller using PELCO-D protocol for Axis YP3040 PTZ motor

Introduction
This is an Arduino-based rotator interface that interfaces a computer to a rotator or rotator controller, emulating the Yaesu GS-232A/B and Easycom protocols which are supported by a myriad of logging, contest, and control programs like PSTRotator. 

Documentation
This project only intends to add a feature to use Axis PTZ motor model YP3040 to the previous development of the Radio Artisan Group. Full documentation maintaned by https://github.com/k3ng/k3ng_rotator_controller. Please read it! Volunteers for maintaining documentation are needed.
